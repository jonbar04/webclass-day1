	<h1><u>My History With Touhou</u></h1>
	<br>
		<p>I've known about touhou for many years, and you may have as well without even knowing! While I'm not exactly sure how long ago it was, I'm sure it was in the early 2010s. <br>
		Due to videos on Youtube featuring the music in YTPMVs or MADs, which are a whole nother can of worms, I was first introduced to touhou music! <br> 
		Now the funny thing about this is that for years those few songs I saw years ago were the only things I knew, until one day in 2019 I asked "what the hell is a touhou" and finally decided to dive in. <br>
		I started like a lot of other fans, with the 6th game in the series, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and slowly worked my way up from there. I would go for a 1cc in each game before moving on to the next one, which is a clear without using a single continue, since those are needed to get the good endings
		most of the time. In fact, here's a chart showing my progress!
		</p>

			Although this seems overwhelming to an outsider, anyone should be able to tell that I've barely <br> scratched the surface. I've only gone through most games as a single character, taking my <br> win and leaving
			I plan to go back and revisit more games, in fact recently I've been playing <br> the fighting games that I've skipped because they've never been my cup of tea. Though I don't <br> really care about going for
			a 1cc on these, I don't have enough faith in my skills to overcome <br> the cheating AI. But besides genre differences, I mainly held off on the spinoffs because I wanted to <br> tackle the mainline games first.
			I've gotten a 1cc on nearly all of them. I currently don't have any <br>plans on revisiting the first game, since that one's just not good. But at some point I will go back and <br> tackle the 5th game. Now I've been talking a lot
			about how I've played all these games, but am I good? <br> Nope! <br> I play on normal all the time, which is fine but it certainly makes my feats less impressive, but hey <br> I'm still having fun so who cares?
			Though one day I'll start tackling higher difficulties more regularly <br> or even some of those harder extra stages since I've never beaten one of those.
