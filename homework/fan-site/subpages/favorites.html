	<h1><u>My Favorites!</u></h1>
	<br>
		<p>
		There was actually a popularity poll recently that I participated in, and while I could just list off my favorites that I voted for there, that would be boring and a little more detail would be more fun!
		I'll be listing my top 3 favorites in 3 categories: characters, games, and music.
		</p>

			Characters

			<div class="subcontainer">
			<img src="../../../images/Th185Nitori.png" width=150px alt="Nitori Kawashiro">
			<h2>Nitori Kawashiro</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			She first appeared in Touhou 10, and is a shy kappa who's real good with technology. She would go on to be playable in later games, looking to make a profit at any opportunity.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subcontainer">
			<img src="../../../images/Th13Yuyuko.png" width=110px alt="Yuyuko Saigyouji">
			<h2>Yuyuko Saigyouji</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			She first appeared as the final boss of Touhou 7. She's a ghost and the leader of the netherworld. Although most of the time she's goofing around, being airheaded or just hungry, she's quite perceptive and a real threat under her friendly personality.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subcontainer">
			<img src="../../../images/Th19Marisa.png" width=225px alt="Marisa Kirisame">
			<h2>Marisa Kirisame</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			First appearing in Touhou 2, Marisa is one of the 2 main characters throughout the whole series, appearing in every game since her debut. She's a human who unlike other magicians, wasn't born with any powers, instead working hard to get to her current level of power. Although very casual and friendly, she's no joke when it comes to firepower.

			<img src="../../../images/Th12cover.jpg" width=225px alt="UFO">
			<h2>Touhou 12 ~ Undefined Fantastic Object</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			Released in 2009, the game's plot revolves around well, an Undefined Fantastic Object. The object in question is a ship flying through the sky, with the goal of unsealing a monk who was sealed away for treating youkai and humans as equals. The game's main gimmick is UFO collectives which give you different items such as lives or power depending on which of the 3 colors you pick up.

			<div class="subcontainer">
			<img src="../../../images/Th18cover.jpg" width=225px alt="UM">
			<h2>Touhou 18 ~ Unconnected Marketeers</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			Released in 2021, the game's plot revolves around mysterious powerful trading cards being produced. These cards contain the powers of various characters throughout the entire series, and are very disruptive due to the craze they cause. The game's main gimmick is these cards, with the game taking a more unique approach, being similar to a roguelike where after each stage you get a shop with randomized cards to purchase to increase your power.
			</p>

			<div class="subcontainer">
			<img src="../../../images/Th17cover.png" width=225px alt="WBaWC">
			<h2>Touhou 17 ~ Wily Beast and Weakest Creature</h2>
			<p style=color:white>
			Released in 2019, the game's plot revolves around beast spirits wreaking havoc. These spirits are planning to leave the Animal Realm of Hell and conquer the surface after a God appears and threatens them. The game's main gimmick is similar to UFO, with animal spirits acting as the collectives instead of UFOs, and the reward being temporary surges of power rather than an item.

			Music
			</h1>

			<div class="subcontainer">
			
			
			<h2>Electric Heritage</h2>
			<audio controls>
			<source src="../../../audio/Electric Heritage.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
			Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio> 
			<p style=color:white>
			This is a track from touhou 19, being the theme of the final stage in the game. As the name implies, it has a very electronic feeling, being one of the few songs in the mainline games that steps away from the usual traditional instruments. The reason for this is the environment of the stage, being the Beast Realm being invaded and modernized by the foreign God.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subcontainer">
			<h2>Green-Eyed Jealousy</h2>
			<audio controls>
			<source src="../../../audio/Green-Eyed Jealousy.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
			Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio> 
			<p style=color:white>
			This is a track from touhou 11, being the theme of the stage 2 boss. It's a very somber song, due to the backstory of Parsee, the boss of that stage. She's the embodiment of jealousy and despised by many, also guarding the "bridge" between the surface and underworld, leading her jealousy to worsen with the people she encounters.
			</div>
			<div class="subcontainer">
			<h2>Vessel of Stars ~ Casket of Star</h2>
			<audio controls>
			<source src="../../../audio/Vessel of Stars ~ Casket of Star.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
			Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio> 
			<p style=color:white>
			This is a track from touhou 10.5, being the theme of Marisa. Since this is a track from a fighting game, it heavily differs from the music in the mainline games, immediately noticeable with the change in instruments. This is actually an arrangement of Marisa's theme from touhou 4. Although the song is pretty short and sweet, its very powerful and the fast pace fits Marisa well.
