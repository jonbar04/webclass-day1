	<h1><u>Touhou Project Abridged History</u></h1>
	
	<br>
		<p>The Touhou series has a history that goes back decades, as far back as 1997. Although when compared to something like Mario, it doesn't seem like that long, this is a series developed primarily by one person.
		The first five games in the series were released from 1997-1998, on the PC-98. Starting in 2002, the games started being released for windows devices. Around this time, ZUN also started releasing albums in a series
		titled "ZUN's Music Collection." The series started to get more in-depth and developed over the years, still staying relatively niche but building up a foundation and reputation in Japan. However like a lot of things,
		the development of the world wide web lead to many Western audiences discovering this niche franchise on websites such as Youtube.

		Music from the series quickly spread on Youtube in the late 2000s and early 2010s, although most of it was from fan groups, known as doujin circles, with the most famous example being IOSYS. They released their music with a good chunk of it having flash animations
		to go along as a music video, which in this age of the internet lead to insane popularity. One funny case of this was a CNN news report about the song "Bad Apple!!" by Alstroemeria Records which went viral around this time and even still today has many people recreating
		the iconic music video in all sorts of mediums. However the CNN report is infamous due to how wrong the story is, they took a stop motion recreation originally uploaded by user shige-ruuu on <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm9519847"> Niconico<a>, and painted it as if that's how the original music video was made.

		Tangent aside, it was also around this time that manga began being produced for the series, with all of these being referred to as "Print works" by the community. These range from sorts of in-universe albums detailing characters and spells to full-fledged stories, with some even still 
		going to this day. In fact, as time has gone on the fanbase in the West has slowly gotten bigger, with more and more fangames and other projects being made, more people eventually get interested.

		None of this would be possible if ZUN wasn't so casual about fanmade content. I'm sure you've heard the stories of Nintendo repeatedly sending projects DMCAs, well nothing of the sort happens. Although there are guidelines set in place for people to follow, it's mostly just common sense such as unlawful content or anything
		infringing on other intellectual properties, as well as providing a disclaimer that it is not official content. This leads to so many people around the world giving back to the community, through art, music, games, etc. The touhou community is one of my favorite communities for this reason,
		there is so much creativity and passion in what people do for this indie franchise that I just find beautiful.

		Here's a timeline I inefficiently made in Photoshop! It includes all of the games and only the games, otherwise it would have taken forever. Games made in collaboration with Twilight Frontier are underlined.
		<br>
		Below is an image of the fan-run wiki just to get my point across at how much there would be on this timeline.
