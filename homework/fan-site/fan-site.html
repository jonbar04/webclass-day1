		<h2>Brief Overview:</h2>
		<p>東方Project, The Touhou Project, or simply Touhou is a series of bullet hells among other various spinoffs developed by Team Shanghai Alice.  <br>
		Team Shanghai Alice consists of a single developer, known as ZUN. The series of over 19 games is incredibly popular, and yet simultaneously unheard of. <br>
		While most of the games are bullet hells developed by ZUN, a good chunk of spinoffs are collaborations with a small studio known as Twilight Frontier. <br>
		The games are heavily inspired by Japanese mythology, with most of the characters being humanizations of Youkai. <br>
		Apologies for the wikipedia-style synopsis but a brief overview on the front page was at least needed for context, go to the <a href="subpages/history.html"> history page<a> for more info!
		</p>
		
		
	<br>
	<p>While to others this may seem like a fairly long time, I still consider myself a fairly new fan of the series, only getting into it in late 2019. <br>
		The series has a lot to offer, with tons of music, games, and manga that I haven't even gotten close to scratching the surface of it all yet. <br>
		I mean part of it is my own laziness, admittedly, but taking on all the challenges is quite a commitment!
