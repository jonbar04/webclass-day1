		<p>I considered following the dream job prompt, but if I'm being perfectly honest I'm not very qualified at this point. <br>
		So instead I'll just list a few random facts about myself!
		</p>
		
		<h2>"Fun" facts!:</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>I was born here in Chicago, but have lived in Kankakee for most of my life</li>
		<li>I'm the oldest child in my family</li>
		<li>I took a gap year between high school and college</li>
		<li>I'm a first generation student</li>
		<li>This is a pretty boring list</li>
		<li>But hey, the work is getting done and I'm enjoying myself!</li>
		<li>This is no longer a list.</li>
		</ul>
